Preface
Welcome to the Fifth Edition of Java Software Solutions, Foundations of
Program Design. We are pleased that this book has served the needs of so many
students and faculty over the years. This edition is designed to further enhance
the pedagogy of introductory computing.
What's New in the Fifth Edition
The overall vision of the book has not changed significantly from that of the
third
edition. The emphasis remains on presenting underlying core concepts. The
Graphics Track sections in each chapter still segregate the coverage of graphics
and graphical user interfaces. The casual writing style and entertaining examples
still rule the day.
The changes made for this edition are designed to permeate and reinforce the
pedagogy of the material. These changes also address some of the trends that are
happening in many Java programming courses. Specifically:
The discussions and examples fully embrace the Java 2 Standard Edition 5.0,
including coverage of:
> The standard Scanner class, which simplifies keyboard input and parsing.
> Enumerated types.
> Autoboxing, which automatically converts primitives to wrapper objects
and vice versa.
> Variable length parameter lists.
> The enhanced for loop, which facilitates iterating over a collection.
> Generic types, which facilitate the definition of collection classes.
We provide a smoother evolution of object-oriented concepts, including a brief
introduction to the most essential elements of writing classes prior to covering
conditionals and loops. We incorporate class examples into all remaining chapters,
adding key aspects of class design as appropriate.
We place a stronger emphasis on object-oriented design, including techniques
for identifying classes, objects, and their relationships.
We have reorganized the flow of graphical user interface (GUI) topics into a
more logical order throughout the Graphics Track sections of each chapter. The
topics from the third edition's "catch all" GUI chapter have been integrated
throughout the text.
We present most example programs dealing with GUIs and graphics as framebased
Java applications instead of applets. Details of applets are now provided in
an appendix.
The reference material in the appendices has been augmented with new topics,
including an overview of GUI events and a summary of regular expressions for
parsing using the Scanner class.
A whole suite of new and improved supplements is available with this edition.
The supplements are discussed in detail later in the preface.
Cornerstones of the Text
This text is based on the following basic ideas that we believe make for a sound
introductory text:
> True object-orientation. A text that really teaches a solid object-oriented
approach must use what we call object-speak. That is, all processing
should be discussed in object-oriented terms. That does not mean, however,
that the first program a student sees must discuss the writing of
multiple classes and methods. A student should learn to use objects before
learning to write them. This text uses a natural progression that culminates
in the ability to design real object-oriented solutions.
> Sound programming practices. Students should not be taught how to program;
they should be taught how to write good software. There's a
difference. Writing software is not a set of cookbook actions, and a good
program is more than a collection of statements. This text integrates practices
that serve as the foundation of good programming skills. These
practices are used in all examples and are reinforced in the discussions.
Students learn how to solve problems as well as how to implement solutions.
We introduce and integrate basic software engineering techniques
throughout the text.
> Examples. Students learn by example. This text is filled with fully implemented
examples that demonstrate specific concepts. We have intertwined
small, readily understandable examples with larger, more realistic ones.
There is a balance between graphics and nongraphics programs.
> Graphics and GUIs. Graphics can be a great motivator for students, and
their use can serve as excellent examples of object-orientation. As such,
we use them throughout the text in a well-defined set of sections that we
call the Graphics Track. This coverage includes the use of event processing
and GUIs. Students learn to build GUIs in the appropriate way by using a
natural progression of topics. The Graphics Track can be avoided entirely
for those who do not choose to use graphics.
Paths Through the Text
This book is designed to be flexible, so that instructors can tailor its
presentation
to the needs of their students. Instructors can take a variety of paths through
the
text. Graphics can be emphasized or deemphasized as desired.
Chapter Breakdown
Chapter 1 (Introduction) introduces computer systems in general, including basic
architecture and hardware, networking, programming, and language translation.
Java is introduced in this chapter, and the basics of general program development,
as well as object-oriented programming, are discussed. This chapter contains
broad introductory material that can be covered while students become familiar
with their development environment.
Chapter 2 (Data and Expressions) explores some of the basic types of data
used in a Java program and the use of expressions to perform calculations. It
discusses
the conversion of data from one type to another, and how to read input
interactively from the user with the help of the standard Scanner class.
Chapter 3 (Using Classes and Objects) explores the use of predefined classes
and the objects that can be created from them. Classes and objects are used to
manipulate character strings, produce random numbers, perform complex
calculations,
and format output. Enumerated types are also discussed.
Chapter 4 (Writing Classes) explores the basic issues related to writing classes
and methods. Topics include instance data, visibility, scope, method parameters,
and return types. Encapsulation and constructors are covered as well. Some of the
more involved topics are deferred to or revisited in Chapter 6.
Chapter 5 (Conditionals and Loops) covers the use of boolean expressions to
make decisions. All related statements for conditionals and loops are discussed,
including the enhanced version of the for loop. The Scanner class is revisited for
iterative input parsing and reading text files.
Chapter 6 (Object-Oriented Design) reinforces and extends the coverage of
issues related to the design of classes. Techniques for identifying the classes
and
objects needed for a problem and the relationships among them are discussed.
This chapter also covers static class members, interfaces, and the design of
enumerated
type classes. Method design issues and method overloading are also
discussed.
Chapter 7 (Arrays) contains extensive coverage of arrays and array processing.
Topics include command-line arguments, variable length parameter lists, and
multidimensional arrays. The ArrayList class and its use as a generic type is
explored as well.
Chapter 8 (Inheritance) covers class derivations and associated concepts such
as class hierarchies, overriding, and visibility. Strong emphasis is put on the
proper use of inheritance and its role in software design.
Chapter 9 (Polymorphism) explores the concept of binding and how it relates
to polymorphism. Then we examine how polymorphic references can be accomplished
using either inheritance or interfaces. Sorting is used as an example of
polymorphism. Design issues related to polymorphism are examined as well.
Chapter 10 (Exceptions) explores the class hierarchy from the Java standard
library used to define exceptions, as well as the ability to define our own
exception
objects. We also discuss the use of exceptions when dealing with input and
output, and examine an example that writes a text file.
Chapter 11 (Recursion) covers the concept, implementation, and proper use of
recursion. Several examples from various domains are used to demonstrate how
recursive techniques make certain types of processing elegant.
Chapter 12 (Data Structures) introduces the idea of a collection and its
underlying
data structure. Abstraction is revisited in this context and the classic data
structures are explored. Generic types are introduced as well. This chapter serves
as an introduction to a CS2 course.
Supplements
A variety of supplemental materials is available for this text. The following
resources are available for all students at www.aw-bc.com/cssupport:
